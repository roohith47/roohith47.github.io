  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a graduate student in the MSIS program at the University of Maryland,
    with a strong interest in analytics, machine learning, and digital
    transformation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic and project work focuses on applying data science and ML
    techniques to real-world problems, particularly in computer vision and
    analytics-driven decision making.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am actively seeking internships and full-time roles where I can
    contribute to data-driven product, analytics, or ML-focused teams.
